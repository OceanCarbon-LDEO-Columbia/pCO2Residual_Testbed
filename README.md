# pCO2Residual_Testbed
Code to implement Bennington et al. 2022 JAMES using CMIP6 testbed

- what notebooks are useful for what tasks (i.e if youre using the already made regridded testbed, which will be on zenodo, you don't need notebook 00)
- now if someone wants to use that for their own ML, they'll make their own pandas dataframes
- put zenodo link in this readme, and the zenodo will include the github link
